    Temperature Converter
    Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a temperature in Celsius and then
    converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C * 9/5) + 32. Your program should then
    print out the converted temperature in Fahrenheit.
    However, if the user enters a temperature below -273.15Â°C (the lowest possible
    temperature in the universe, also known as absolute zero), your program should print an
    error message instead of attempting to convert the temperature.
    Note: You can assume that the user will enter a valid input (a number for the temperature in Celsius).
