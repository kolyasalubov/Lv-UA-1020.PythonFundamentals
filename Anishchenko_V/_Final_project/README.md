# Replica of classic MINESWEEPER game.

**Rules** are simple:

1. The goal is to complete the board without detonating any mines.

2. To start the game, just cross the fingers and click on any cell on the board. You can also use "Quick Start" button, about which see below.

3. Left-click to clear a cell from the board. If you suspect that the cell has a mine (or are sure about it), right-click to set flag on that cell.

4. As the board clears, opened cells show number of mines surrounding them - use those hints to win!

Three radio buttons on top of the window allow to chose complexity level.

Once you've won or lost you can chose another level or restart the same by clicking on emoji icon.

You can also hit "Quick Start", in which case the program randomly opens a few cells that are definitely not mined. You will find this tool handy on 'expert' and 'medium' levels, on which chances to hit a mine on the first or second click are higher and can make you annoyed very quickly. The "Quick Start" feature is the only addition to the classic game which many of the office plankton species used to kill time with on their Windows XPs back in 00s.

Small window on the left displays number of mines on the board, less those which you've discovered (or you think you've discovered).

Finally, a window on the right shows - in seconds - time spent to win (or lose) the game.
